# Master_Thesis

This project compares real and simulated LiDAR data across various artifacts such as blooming, noise, and statistical properties. It automates the analysis workflow, computing ECDFs, bias, and CAVM metrics, and generates interactive HTML reports for easy visualization. The pipeline is designed for end-to-end automation, from parsing different PCD formats to producing charts and summaries, making large-scale comparison efficient and reproducible.
